# KDE: **K**ernel **D**ensity **E**stimation for Structural Distributions of Molecular Systems

**KDE** is a program designed to calculate the structural distributions of a system using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).
The program focuses on computing Radial Distribution Function (RDF), Bond Distribution Function (BDF), Angle Distribution Function (ADF), Torsion Distribution Function (TDF), and Improper Distribution Function (IDF) from molecular dynamics simulations.

## Overview

This application processes data from LAMMPS simulations, allowing users to analyze structural distributions in a material or molecular system.
The program supports both serial and parallel processing to handle large datasets efficiently.

### Key Features

- **RDF Calculation:** Analyze the spatial distribution of particles in the system.
- **BDF Calculation:** Measure the distribution of bond lengths between particles.
- **ADF Calculation:** Evaluate the distribution of angles formed by triplets of particles.
- **TDF Calculation:** Assess the distribution of torsion angles formed by quadruplets of particles.
- **IDF Calculation:** Compute the distribution of improper dihedral angles in the system.
- **Parallel Processing:** Leverage multi-threading for efficient computation on modern processors.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are installed before deploying the code:

- `libeigen3-dev`: A C++ template library for linear algebra.
- `cmake`: A cross-platform build system.
- `gcc-9` or newer: The GNU Compiler Collection.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and compile the KDE program:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/kde.git
   cd kde
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries:**

   Navigate to the `lib` directory and run the provided script to download the necessary libraries:

   ```bash
   cd lib
   ./get_fmt.sh
   ```

3. **Create a Build Directory:**

   Set up a separate build directory to keep things organized:

   ```bash
   mkdir release
   cd release
   ```

4. **Compile the Program:**

   Use `cmake` to generate the build files, and then compile the program:

   ```bash
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
   make -j <number_of_threads>
   ```

5. **Run the Program:**

   Execute the program with an input file:

   ```bash
   ./kde ../data/kde.ini
   ```

   This will generate the required distributions based on the provided configuration.

## Usage

The program requires an input `.ini` file that specifies the paths to the LAMMPS data and dump files, as well as the settings for the different distribution calculations.

### Sample Input File (`kde.ini`)

Below is an example of what your input file should look like:

```ini
###################################################
#             Input for the KDE code              #
###################################################

################### Inputs ########################
# Path to LAMMPS data file (*.lammps)
# lammps_data <path_to_LAMMPS_format_data_file>
lammps_data     ../tests/alpha_a5b2c10.lammps

# Path to LAMMPS trajectory (dump) file (*.lammpstrj)
# lammps_dump <path_to_LAMMPS_format_trajectory_file>
lammps_dump     ../tests/alpha_a5b2c10.lammpstrj

# Output tag ("CG" is default)
# tag <output_tag>
# NOTE: Output file format (for rdf and pair type AA): rdf-<tag>_AA.txt
tag     cg

################ Type Definition ###################
# System phase (crystal, amorphous (default))
# phase <crystal/amorphous>
phase crystal

# Input data file atom types definition (needs to be adjusted)
# type  <type_number> <type_name>
# NOTE: The type number for each system is different
type 	1	c1
type	2	c2
type	3	c3
type	4	hc

# Bead types definition (one or more beads)
# bead   <bead_name> <atom_1_type_name> ...
# weight <bead_name> <atom_1_weight> ...
# NOTE: The weight and bead commands should match each other
# NOTE: Repeat the `bead` and `weight` commands for defining each bead
bead	A	  c3 	c1 	  c2
weight	A	0.333 0.334 0.333

############## Distribution Settings ###############
# Processing method (parallel(default), serial)
# process serial

# NOTE: If number_of_threads is left blank, the maximum available is used

```

### Running Tests

Sample data and input files are provided in the `data` folder for testing purposes.
To run a test, adjust the input file `kde.ini` as needed, and then execute:

```bash
./kde ../data/kde.ini
```

This will process the sample data and output the computed distributions to files.

## Python Plotting Script

A Python script is provided in the repository for generating plots of the structural distributions.
This script processes the output files generated by the KDE program and produces visualizations for the RDF, BDF, ADF, TDF, and IDF.

### Running the Plotting Script

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

To run the script, execute the following command in the directory where your output files are located:

```bash
./plot_distributions.py
```

The plots will be saved in a folder named `plots` by default.

## Notes on Sample Data

The sample data files provided in the `data` folder have been reduced in size to keep the repository manageable.
Due to the reduced number of timesteps, the resulting distributions may appear noisy.
For more accurate and smoother distributions, it is recommended to use larger data files with more timesteps.

### Performance Note

Please note that calculating distributions using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) can be computationally intensive and may take longer, especially on older hardware or when processing larger systems.
Each of the provided systems contains about 10,000 atoms, which can significantly increase computation time.
This is a known characteristic of KDE compared to histogram-based methods.
If the computation takes longer than expected, itâ€™s likely due to the processing requirements rather than an issue with the program itself.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available and can be generated using Doxygen. The documentation covers all classes, methods, and functionalities of the KDE program.

### Generating Documentation
